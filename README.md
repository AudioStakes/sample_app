To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```

```
$ rails server
```

```

To run all the tests, simplu hit return at the `guard>` prompt.
